		@class XdevLJoystick
		@brief Interface class for joystick devices.
		@author Cengiz Terzibas

		@section xdevl_joystick_xml Plugin & Module information

		The plugin for this module is a built in plugin in @b XdevL @b 0.1 and that means that you don't have to
		plug this plugin manually because it's pluged already :).

		@section xdevl_joystick_xml_create Creating the module

		Here I show you how you can create a Module (object from that pluged plugin). Use the xdl::createModule()
		function in your application and use the following information:

		- plugin_name = @b "XdevLJoystick"
		- module_name = @b "XdevLJoystick"

		to create the module. The plugin name has no relation to the file name of the plugin. It's an internal
		literal identification code.
		Here an example how we create an valid XdevLJoystick object:

		@code
		XdevLJoystick* joystick = xdl::createModule<xdl::XdevLJoystick*>(	core,
																			plugin_name,
																			module_name,
																			"MyJoystick");
		@endcode

		The last parameter @e "MyJoystick" is the identification code for that created object. You could not use the
		same name for a different module. Internaly the system will change this literal into an unique integer value.
		This value will be used for identifying messages and requests to that module.

		Here another method to create a valid XdevLJoystick object. You can instruct XdevLCore to create
		the module via the XML file. Add the "<Modules>" section (if not added already) into the main core XML
		file. To instruct that XdevLCore should create a valid object of that module add the "<Module>" element.
		The "<Modules>" section of the XML file should look like this:

		@code
		<Modules>
	    <Module id="MyJoystick" plugin_name="XdevLJoystick" module_name="XdevLJoystick"> </Module>
	  </Modules>
		@endcode

		In your application use the getModule() function with the specified 'id' parameter in your applicaton
		to get the created object.

		@code
		XdevLJoystick* joystick = xdl::getModule<xdl::XdevLJoystick*>(core, "MyJoystick");
		@endcode

		@section xdevl_joystick_xml_element Xml Format.

		@subsection xdevl_xml_joystick_device "<XdevLJoystick>" Block
			- Attributes:
				- id = identification code
			-	Elements:
				- "<Range>"
				- "<ClickResponseTime>"

		@subsection xdevl_xml_joystick_device_range "<Range>" Block
			- Attributes:
				- axis : Specifies the axis.
				- min  : The minimum value for the axis.
				- max  : The maximum value for the axis.
			- Elements:
				- none

		The attribute @e axis specifies the axis number which should be set.
		@subsection xdevl_xml_joystick_device_crt "<ClickResponseTime>" Block
			- Attributes:
				- value

		This is the clicked response time (crt) block. The @b value attribute has the unit @e seconds.
		You can set the @e crt manually with the setClickResponseTime() function.

		Here an example:
		@code
	  <XdevLJoystick id="MyJoystick">
	    <ClickResponseTime value="0.5"></ClickResponseTime>
	  </XdevLJoystick>
		@endcode
		We change the click response time (crt) for the joystick device '0' to 500 @e ms.

		@section xdevl_joystick_button_axis_id Supported identification codes
		- xdl::eXdevLJoyButton joystick button id's.
		- xdl::eXdevLJoyAxis joystick axis id's.
		- xdl::eXdevLJoyPOV joystick POV id's.

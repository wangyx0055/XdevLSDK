	  @author Cengiz Terzibas

	  This buffer is a self managed buffer. The main purpose of this class
	  is to manage incomming items.
		Let's say we have incomming packages from the UDP socket. The first thing
		we have to do is get it out of the buffer as fast as possible to prevent
		dropouts. We can use this buffer to do that.

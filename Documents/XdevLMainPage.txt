@section xdevl_intro Introduction
Hello and welcome to the world of XdevL.
	 
XdevL is an abbreviation and means eXtended DEVice Library. The main capability 
of XdevL is managing plug-ins and modules in an easy way. At the moment 
(the release version 0.3 of XdevL) 9 plug-ins are provided. You can use them to 
play sounds, check keyboard, mouse and joystick events, render 3D graphics with 
OGRE or raw OpenGL and sending data over the network using UDP sockets.

@section xdevl_reason Reason to use
-# Lot less re-compiling and re-linking.A bugfix of a plugin will not force you to recompile your project.
Only that plugin needs to be compiled.
-# Extreme Modular. The system can be extended using new plugins.
-# Uses modern C++11/14 features.

@section xdevl_features Features

-# Uses C++11 standard.
-# Cross Platform (GNU/Linux, MacOSX and Windows supported. Android and IOS are planed.)
-# Supports plugins and modules which makes the system extreme expandable and flexible.
-# Shared memory,Semaphore support using XdevLSharedMemory and XdevLSemaphore class.
-# Basic threading support thread::Thread and thread::Mutex and thread::ConditionalVariable.
-# Xml file parsing (it's the tinyxml project http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml/)
-# Extended string/filename parsing.
-# Support for fast delegates. (Another way of callback functions).
-# Array manipulators.
-# Support for different types of control devices like, Keyboard, Mouse and Joystick
-# Cross platform 3D rendering using XdevLRAI. One implementation is using OpenGL 3.3+ and Vulkan is planned.
-# Audio playback and record using XdevLAudioPlayback and XdevLAudioCapture.
-# Bluetooth and Serial port support.
-# Networking TCP/UDP.
-# File/Folder handling using XdevLFile, XdevLDirectory and XdevLDirectoryWatcher.
-# OpenGL context using native version as GLX, WGL, CGL and EGL.
-# Support for font rendering using XdevLFont and XdevLRAI
-# Image import support for Jpeg, Png, Bmp and TGA files.

@section xdevl_compiler Supported compiler
At the moment the following compilers are supported:

- Visual Studio 2005 + SP1
- Visual Studio 2005 Express + SP1 + PlatformSDK
- Visual Studio 2008 + SP1
- Visual Studio 2010
- Visual Studio 2012
- Clang 3.3, 3.5, 3.7
- GNU Compliler >= 4.8.x

@section xdevl_requirements Requirements
You need CMake at least 2.8. Create whichever build projects you like.

@section xdevl_usage Usage
The first question of course is, "What is XdevL?" and after understanding that
the next question is maybe "Ok, I want to use XdevL but where should I start?" :) 
and here is the answer:

-# To understand XdevL read the manual which is in the /doc folder
-# To use XdevL do the following:
	-# You have to install the SDK. (Or compile from the source.)
	-# You must set the environment variables for XdevL.
	-# You should check out the demos in the XdevLDemos folder to understand how
			to use XdevL.

@section sourceforge_source Git source
The main branch of XdevL is heavily under development. I recommend not using the 
master of this project or you will have troubles later compiling your code. Use 
the release version instead.

	@page xdevl_version_definition Version number

	XdevL's version number has 3 digit numbers: @b 'major'.@b 'minor'.@b 'patch'
	
	- The @b 'major' level can have a completely new API architecture and isn't 
		compatible with other 'major' level versions.
	- The @b 'minor' level has additional API functions but the old ones aren't 
		changed. 
	- The @b 'patch' level is only a bug fixed version. No API changes are done in 
		the release.
	
	The 0.'x'.'y' series is a special version and will have some changes in the 
	architecture and API. But I hope it will not affect your code too much.
	
	Here some additional information that can be with the version number:
	
	- Alpha: A real early stage of the library.
	- Beta: It's for testing purposes only. 
	- RC: Release Candidate 
	- Release: Final version.
	- Patch: Only changes in the patch level.
	
	Here an example: @b XdevL @b Beta @b 0.1.2
	
	This is a beta testing version with bug fixes included.

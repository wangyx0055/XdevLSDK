# XdevLSDK
XdevL is a powerful cross-platform C++ Object and Plug-In Oriented programming framework which helps you developing 
Games or device oriented applications. The whole system can be extended using/developing additional Plugins which
makes it extreme flexible.

# Why would you use it?
* Lot less re-compiling and re-linking of your program.A bugfix of a plugin will not force you to recompile your project.
Only that plugin needs to be compiled.
* Extreme Modular. The system can be extended using new plugins.
* Uses modern C++11/(14) features.
* You can use it to build your own game engine.

# Here some features
* Uses C++11/(14) standard.
* Cross Platform (GNU/Linux, MacOSX and Windows supported. Android and IOS are planed.)
* Supports plugins and modules which makes the system extreme expandable and flexible.

* Extended string/filename parsing.
* Support for fast delegates. (Another way of callback functions).
* Array manipulators.
* Support for different types of control devices like, Keyboard, Mouse and Joystick
* Cross platform 3D rendering using XdevLRAI. One implementation is using OpenGL 3.3+ and Vulkan is planned.
* Audio playback and record using XdevLAudioPlayback and XdevLAudioCapture.
* Bluetooth and Serial port support.
* Networking TCP/UDP.
* File/Folder handling using XdevLFile, XdevLDirectory and XdevLDirectoryWatcher.
* OpenGL context using native version as GLX, WGL, CGL and EGL.
